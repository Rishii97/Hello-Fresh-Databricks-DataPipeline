# Databricks notebook source
# __init__.py

# This file marks the `configs` directory as a Python package
# You can also import commonly used elements here to make them available directly from `configs`.

# Example: If you want to make specific configurations directly available via `from configs import config_name`, you can add:
# from .configs import some_config_variable, some_function

# For now, it's an empty file, which is fine for marking the directory as a package.
